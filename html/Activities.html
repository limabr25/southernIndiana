		  		<h1><large>Big Four Bridge</large></h1>
		  		
		    <p> A great addition to the Kentuckiana area is the Big Four Bridge across the Ohio River from Jeffersonville, IN to Louisville, KY.The pedestrian bridge is accessible both on the Indiana and Kentucky sides.  On any day, many enjoy the excercise and great views of the river and city.  There is also a playground at the base of the bridge where kids can play. The recent installation of LED lights make the bridge something to see at night.  This would be a great outing with kids, on a date or with family visiting from out of town.  Many great restaurants, ice cream shops and stores are popping up within walking distance from the bridge.  Dogs are not allowed, but bicycles and strollers are.  Overall, it is a great, unique and FREE activity! </p>
